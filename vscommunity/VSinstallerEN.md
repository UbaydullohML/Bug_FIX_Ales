You can also use the vs_installer.exe --locale en-US command-line option to start the Visual Studio installer in English, regardless of the primary language of your system or the language of any previous versions of Visual Studio that you have installed.
I hope this helps!, how to use it and where

Find the below file and install below code:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vs_installer.exe"

    vs_installer.exe --locale en-US
